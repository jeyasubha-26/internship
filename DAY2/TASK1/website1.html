    <h1>Product Hunt</h1>
    <p>At Product Hunt, hunting a product is often the same thing as launching a product â€” makers hunt their own product when they're ready to launch it. However, products can also be hunted by others; anyone with an account. People hunt products because they like them and want to share them.</p>
